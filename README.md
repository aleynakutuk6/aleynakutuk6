### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Specialist at TEB Arf. I earned my B.Sc. in Computer Science & Engineering from SabancÄ± University, then completed my M.Sc. @ [KUIS AI](https://ai.ku.edu.tr/) - [IUI](https://iui.ku.edu.tr/) labs under Prof. Metin Tevfik Sezgin. Although my research background centers on free-hand sketch analysis and computer vision, Iâ€™m currently focusing primarily on natural language processing.
